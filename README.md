# Mini-Project-System-Development-DIT112
The course is a part of the Software Engineering and Management program at Gothenburg University and Chalmers University of Technology.

The course introduces a project, based on a problem based learning approach, guided by realistic and challenging customer requirements. The project course is organized as group work. Based on an idea, the students shall deliver a requirement and design specification of the system to be developed. The system, that consist of an already existing hardware and software platform shall be controlled by software.

The students shall implement the software part based on the design, test and demonstrate the results. In this course the students learn to analyze the demands of a customer, capture these in a software requirements specification including quality requirements, and to design and develop software from this analysis. The students train their skills in requirements analysis, software design, quality analysis, programming, and testing.

During the work the students will utilize modern techniques, methods and approaches for system and software development and project management. The system aspects integrated in the software implementation will be in the focus of the project.
